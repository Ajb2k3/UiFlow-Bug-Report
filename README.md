# UiFlow-Bug-Report
This repository was created for the exact purpose of reporting bugs in UiFlow
and suggesting new features.

# How to report a bug
Please make extra sure before posting that what you think is a bug is not
just a syntax error.

1. Click on the issues tab
2. Click the New Issue button
3. Try to write a good title and description for the bug you found.
4. Detailed notes on how the bug was produced, What version of M5Stack firmware
you used and which version of the Uiflow you used e.g. Beta online version, 
Offline version and what operating system and browser you were using.
Screenshots can also prove very helpful. All of this information helps our
engineers to resolve the problem much easier.

Thanks for your continued support. Let's make UiFlow better together
